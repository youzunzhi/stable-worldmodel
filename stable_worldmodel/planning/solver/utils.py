    """Extend or generate an initial action sequence to cover the full horizon.

    When the model implements the Actionable protocol, any missing planning
    steps are filled by calling
    ``model.get_action(info_dict, horizon=remaining, prefix_actions=init_action)``,
    so the actor is rolled out from the latent state reached after applying
    the existing warm-start actions.
    When the model is not Actionable, missing steps are zero-padded instead.
    If ``init_action`` already covers the full horizon it is returned unchanged.

    Args:
        model: The solver's world model.
        info_dict: Current observation dict with shape ``(n_envs, ...)``.
        init_action: Optional previous plan of shape ``(n_envs, t, action_dim)``
            where ``t <= horizon``.
        horizon: Full planning horizon expected by the solver.
        n_envs: Number of parallel environments.
        action_dim: Flattened action dimension.
        device: Target device for the returned tensor (typically the solver's
            device). When ``None``, the device is borrowed from ``init_action``
            if given, otherwise torch's default device is used.

    Returns:
        Action tensor of shape ``(n_envs, horizon, action_dim)`` on ``device``.
